        Hello! My name is Alison McAleer. I am in the Ed.S program for Information Technology and Design. My background is in Special Education and I also have a Masters in Educational Leadership. I have 3 daughters all under the age of 5. I am currently a 2nd grade teacher, however, I love photography, crafting, and traveling with my family!
