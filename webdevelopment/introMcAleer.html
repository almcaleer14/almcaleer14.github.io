     Hello World! My name is Alison McAleer. I am in the Ed.S program for Information Technology and Design. My background is in Special Education and I also have a Masters in Educational Leadership. I have 3 daughters, all under the age of 5. I am currently a 2nd grade teacher, however, I love; photography, crafting, and traveling with my family! My favorite out of these hobbies (aside from travelling with the family) is photography! I have recently been diving more into reading which I am also excited about! I did a brief coding class in high school so I consider myself to have minimal experience in web development. My expectations are that I can learn how to code properly and get a firm foundation on how to develop meaningful content for audiences. I would love to develop some educational websites in the future.
